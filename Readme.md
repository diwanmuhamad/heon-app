### 1. Problem

Lack of information about the new market and limited knowledge from both buyers and MSMEs: This problem indicates that buyers and MSMEs may not have access to comprehensive information about new markets. This lack of knowledge can create challenges in identifying potential opportunities, understanding market dynamics, and making informed decisions. 

Solving this problem requires providing buyers and MSMEs with access to relevant market information, market research, and educational resources to enhance their understanding of market trends, consumer behavior, and industry best practices.

### 2. User Flow

When users try to search for sellers, they can specify certain criteria. For example:

Sellers located in Jakarta
Sellers offering X products
Sellers capable of delivering Y products per day
Sellers with a good credit loan record
To find these sellers, users simply need to engage in a chat on our app. The app takes care of the following steps:

Receives input from the user
Processes the input using our LangChain tools
Connects our Language Learning Models (LLMs) to the necessary data sources based on the user's input
The output will be presented as seller profiles and detailed information tailored to the user's requirements. If necessary, the output can also be displayed graphically to showcase the sellers' monthly or yearly track records.
